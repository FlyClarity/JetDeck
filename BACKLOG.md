# Backlog

Ideas and requests noted for later — not part of the current Phase 1 build order.

- **Buy a domain + finish Postmark setup** (raised after Step 13):
  inbound email (Step 7) is built but not actually live — `jetdeck.app`
  is hardcoded in the code (Clerk webhook's inbound address generation,
  outbound sender fallback) but isn't a domain anyone owns yet. Needed,
  in order:
  1. Buy a domain (not necessarily `jetdeck.app` specifically — just
     needs to be decided)
  2. Point it at the Vercel project (currently only reachable via the
     `.vercel.app` preview URL)
  3. Create a Postmark account, set up an Inbound stream
  4. Add an MX record for an inbound subdomain (e.g.
     `inbound.<domain>`) pointing at Postmark's inbound mail servers
  5. Configure Postmark's inbound webhook → `/api/webhooks/postmark`
     with Basic Auth matching `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  Once a domain is picked, the hardcoded `jetdeck.app` references need
  to be swapped for it (and made configurable via env var instead of
  hardcoded again). This also blocks testing real inbound sources like
  NBAA Air Mail, since nothing can forward mail to an address that
  doesn't resolve anywhere yet.

- **Aircraft photos + expanded amenities** (raised after Step 5): Fleet
  currently only tracks `hasWifi` as a boolean. Eventually needs:
  - Photo upload/gallery per aircraft (Vercel Blob is the natural fit
    since we're already on Vercel)
  - Amenities as a flexible list (e.g. JSON array like
    `["wifi", "galley", "lavatory", "flat_screen"]`) rather than one
    boolean column per amenity

- **In-app calendar view** (raised after Step 6): a calendar grid of
  trips inside JetDeck itself — organized by date + tail for
  part135/hybrid operators, by date only for pure brokers (no fleet
  to organize by). Not the same as the brief's Phase 2.6 calendar
  *sync* (which just pushes trips to external Google/Outlook
  calendars via iCal feeds). Would likely live at the already-planned
  `/trips` route, whose actual UI was never specified in the brief.

- **Separate Dispatch dashboard** (raised after Step 12): the current
  Quoting Queue (`/dashboard`) is sales-focused — trip requests,
  scoring, quoting. Once a trip is accepted and moves to dispatch/ops
  (Step 18's Trip creation), it needs its own dashboard for the
  dispatch team, distinct from the sales queue. Natural fit for the
  already-planned `/trips` route once Trip records exist — nothing to
  build yet since there's no Trip data until Step 16 (accept) → 18
  (trip creation) land. Also relevant to the brief's role hierarchy
  (Sales vs. Dispatch as distinct operator roles) — may eventually
  want role-based routing/defaults, not just a shared nav link.

- **Automate flight/repositioning time calculation** (raised after
  Step 13; shipped after Step 13.5 once the user provided the airport
  dataset). Quote Builder is now leg-based and self-computing:
  - `Airport` table seeded with 10,420 real airports (OurAirports
    dataset, user-provided) — icao/iata/name/lat/lon/elevation
  - `lib/geo.ts` — haversine great-circle distance + estimated flight
    hours (`distance / cruiseSpeedKts + defaultBlockTimeBufferHours`)
  - `AirportCombobox` — searchable, autofilling airport picker
    (`lib/airport-server.ts`'s `searchAirports`, debounced, ICAO/IATA/
    name prefix match)
  - Quote Builder renders one editable row per leg (dep, arr, date,
    flight hours, revenue-vs-repositioning), prefilled from the trip
    request's requested legs plus auto-added repositioning legs
    (home base → first departure, last arrival → home base — skipped
    entirely when they'd be a 0nm no-op, e.g. aircraft already at the
    departure airport)
  - Flight hours auto-recompute live as airports/aircraft change,
    unless the user directly edits a leg's hours (marks it "dirty";
    a "Reset to auto" link reverts it)
  - "Returns to home base" toggle: on (default) adds the trailing
    return leg, no overnight fee; off drops that leg and
    auto-calculates nights away from the gaps between requested legs'
    dates (`nightsBetween` in `lib/geo.ts`), billed at
    `defaultOvernightFee`/night, with an editable "additional nights"
    field for open-ended cases
  - `Quote.itinerary` now stores the full per-leg breakdown (billAs,
    airports, date, flightHours) instead of a single repeated total;
    old quotes created before this shipped are read back
    compatibly (missing `billAs`/`date` default to revenue/derived
    from `depDt`)
  Known gap: the live airport search-as-you-type couldn't be verified
  in this sandbox (no route to the live Neon DB locally, same
  limitation as everywhere else in this project) — the math and
  layout were verified with mocked airport data instead. Worth a
  quick smoke test on the deployed app: type a partial ICAO/name into
  a leg's airport field and confirm results appear.
  Not done: repositioning always assumes `Aircraft.homeBase`, never
  `currentBase` (the "updated as trips complete" field already in the
  schema) — so back-to-back trips don't yet chain repositioning from
  wherever the aircraft actually ended up last. Also, opportunity
  scoring's positioning logic is still qualitative text, not tied to
  this new hours math yet.

- **Multiple itinerary variations per quote** (raised after Step 13.5):
  the user asked about presenting two options on the same quote — e.g.
  the same trip priced from a more efficient departure airport vs. the
  requested one, so the client can pick. Not scoped or built yet, just
  flagging the design fork for when we get to it: (a) a `Quote` gets a
  `variants`/`options` array so one quote record holds N priced
  itineraries, client page shows a picker, or (b) each variation is
  its own sibling `Quote` row (new `quoteGroupId` or similar linking
  them) sent together. (b) fits the current schema with much less
  disruption — `Quote` is already a flat, self-contained pricing
  record — but (a) is the more natural authoring experience in the
  Quote Builder (duplicate a draft, tweak the airport, compare
  side-by-side before sending). Worth scoping properly before Step 14
  if the user wants to prioritize it, since it touches the client quote
  page (Step 15, not built yet) too — better to design it in from the
  start than retrofit.

- **AI profitability / margin analysis on quotes** (raised after Step
  13.5): the user wants the AI layer to surface how profitable a trip
  actually is, not just suggest a sell price. What exists today:
  `lib/ai/suggest-price.ts` recommends a total price using the
  aircraft's hourly rate, positioning, and quote history — no cost
  basis at all, so it can't compute margin. `lib/ai/score-opportunity.ts`
  (Quoting Queue's score badges) is also cost-blind — it only reasons
  about availability/positioning/history, not profitability, despite
  the original build brief's illustrative example text ("est. margin
  38%") suggesting otherwise; that number was never actually
  implemented. To do this for real needs a real operating-cost basis
  per aircraft (fuel burn, maintenance reserve, crew cost, insurance/
  hangar amortized per hour, etc.) that doesn't exist in the schema
  yet. The user's own instinct is right: this is a natural fit for
  Phase 2.4 (Owner Monthly Settlement Statements), which will already
  need per-aircraft cost data to compute owner settlements — build the
  cost model once, use it for both. Once that data exists, `suggest-
  price.ts` and `score-opportunity.ts` could both be extended to
  reason about margin, not just sell price.
